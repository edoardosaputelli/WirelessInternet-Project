# Wireless Internet Project: MAC Randomization
Wireless Internet - Project - From the course held at PoliMi during the year 2021/2022

## Aim of the examination
Modern smartphones randomize their MAC address during probe request emission. <br /> 
You are requested to produce a dataset characterizing the MAC randomization of your own device, following what done in the following paper: “A dataset of labelled device Wi-Fi probe requests for MAC address de-randomization” by L. Pintor and L. Aztori, Computer Networks, Vol. 205, March 2022. <br />
The project should output a set of .pcap files, containing probe requests emitted from your smartphones in different conditions (screen on/off, Wi-Fi on/off, Power saving on/off) to characterize the randomization behaviour of your smartphone. A final report is required to describe your findings.
